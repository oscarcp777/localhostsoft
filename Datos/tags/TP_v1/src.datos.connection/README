Hello,

libspopc is a thin pop3 client library written in C.
It internally uses sort of blocking sockets (15s timeout).
It exports a high-level API that does not expose
the socket to you, unless you want to use the
low-level API (but don't use both! they may conflict).

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details (COPYING.LIB).

- if you are under windows, import the files into you IDE,
and compile with the wsock32 library as linker options
the archive contains a functionnal dev-cpp project file.
You have to download openssl for win32 for SSL connections.

- if you want to disable SSL support, compile without
the #define USE_SSL and without -lcrypto -lssl in LDFLAGS
(see CFLAGS and LDFLAGS in Makefile)

- if you want to disable thread-safety, compile without
the #define _REENTRANT and without -lrt in LDFLAGS
(see CFLAGS and LDFLAGS in Makefile)

- manuals are in doc/ directory

- under Unices, type "make install" to install libspopc.a
and libsopoc.so in /usr/lib/ plus libspopc.h in /usr/include
(you must be root to do that)

To link your program with libspopc, just add
#include <libspopc.h> before your main function
and compile as:
cc -o program program.c -lspopc
